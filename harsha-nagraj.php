          <p>
            I believe it is my birth right to tread the path of Yoga, thought it took me almost a decade and a half to realize that… the reason for my birth & to know the secrets of one’s own life has always been my core question since birth.
<br/><br/>
When the study of Yoga and Prasthanathrayas (Brahma Sutras, Upanisads ,the Bhagavad Gita) and the mother of all languages, Sanskrit began, I knew that I had found what I was searching for all these years. Studying these brought a whole new dimension in my thinking as I stood as a mere witness, spell bound.
<br/><br/>
I found a new meaning in life In fact I found the true meaning of life. A subtle understanding of the philosophy of yoga has revolutionized the evolution in me as I Learn to live in the world, but not the part of the world.
<br/><br/>
This ancient Indian knowledge has completely changed my life. Come and change yours. Be reborn every day!!!! Hari Om !!!
