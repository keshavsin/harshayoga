            Bali, also known as the "Land of the Gods", is the most famous island in Indonesia. It stakes a serious claim to be paradise on earth.<br/>
Bali’s looming volcanoes and lush, terraced rice fields exude both serenity and sublimity. Bali is known for its dramatic dances, intricately carved temples, colorful ceremonies, arts and crafts, luxurious beach resorts and exciting night life. From inspirational spirituality to fine dining and meeting experiences, from world class surfing and diving to exhilarating treks in the wild, this exotic island has much to offer.<br/>
Ubud, is where the retreat will happen, is a small town in central Bali. Far removed from the beach party scene, Ubud is the cultural center of Bali. Much of the town and nearby villages consist of artists’ workshops and galleries. The ubiquitous creativity, remarkable architecture and calm, warm vibe make Ubud a perfect place to relax, recharge and, of course, practice yoga.
