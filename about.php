				Harsha is greatly influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda & his master Sri Ramakrishna Pramahamsa & Sharada devi.
				<br/><br/>
				He says its his birth right to thread the path of Yoga, thought it took him almost a decade and a half to realize that.The reason for my birth & to know the secrets of ones own life has always been his core question since birth.
				<br/><br/>
				When his study of Yoga and Prasthanathrayas (Brahma Sutras, Upanisads ,the Bhagavad Gita) and the mother of all languages, Sanskrit began, he knew that he had found what he was searching for all these years. Studying these brought a whole new dimension in his thinking as he stood as a mere witness, spell bound.
