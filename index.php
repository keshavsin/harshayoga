      <p>Yoga is a challenge within itself- This is exactly what I learnt going to Harsha Yoga Paathashaala. I joined the classes with minimal flexibility and within a month I noticed changes. Harsha noticed these changes and guided me with the next level of the aasans which helped me improve further . His classes make use of props which helps us take that extra step towards perfection. A combination of the mantras with the surya namaskaras fill our mornings with high energy and positivity . Pranayama and meditation bring total peace to the mind which takes us away from the hustle and bustle of this fast moving city life. Loved my experience with Harsha Yoga Paathashaala
